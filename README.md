# SVM-and-RandomForest Model
Background: Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It's commonly caused by a viral infection. There can be many reasons for hepatitis like consumption of alcohol and other toxins or irregular food habits. An adverse case of hepatitis, if not diagnosed properly prior, may cause person death. 

Problem Statement: Given a dataset of hepatitis, build a machine learning model based SVM and Random forest, which should able to predict the case of a person's death (yes/no). As the dataset contains the missing value, handle these values with appropriate data imputation method.  

About the dataset: The dataset contains 155 instances and 19 attributes. It also contains missing values. The class label present in the dataset showing whether the person died or alive. Some of the attributes information are age, sex, steroid, antivirals, fatigue, malaise etc. The datasets can be obtained from the following Machine Learning Repository with the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis.
